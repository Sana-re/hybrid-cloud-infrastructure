# Architecture Diagram Descriptions (Image-Free)

This project uses several architecture diagrams which cannot be uploaded due to GitHub image upload restrictions.  
This document explains each diagram so reviewers can understand the system design.

---

## 1. Hybrid Cloud System Architecture
- Proxmox VE running on local hardware  
- Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) public instance  
- Private internal network for lab workloads  
- Public-facing web server hosted in OCI  
- Routing between environments  
- Backup and replication paths

---

## 2. Proxmox Network Topology
- `vmbr0` → External NAT bridge for internet access  
- `vmbr1` → Internal /24 subnet for VMs  
- Firewall segmentation rules  
- Linux + Windows VM placement  
- Static IP layout and DHCP strategy

---

## 3. Security Governance Model
- Authentication + least privilege access  
- SSH key-based access  
- OCI security lists  
- Proxmox firewall policies  
- Isolated internal workloads

---

## 4. Backup & Continuity Workflow
- Proxmox snapshots before updates  
- OCI automated backups  
- Manual recovery workflows  
- Rollback strategy using LXC containers and Proxmox snapshots

---

## 5. Ansible Automation Flow
- Inventory definition  
- Playbook execution  
- Linux + Windows patching  
- Automated deployments (nginx, K3s)  
- Post-verification logs
